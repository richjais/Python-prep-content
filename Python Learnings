Sorting a list by two fields, both fields should be iterable then
First Approach: using sorted() function with operator.itemgetter(i,j) to sort list by i-th element and then by j-th element.
SYNTAX: sorted_list = sorted(arr, key = operator.itemgetter(1,0))

Second Approach: using sorted() function with lambda expression
SYNTAX: sorted_list = sorted(arr, key = lambda x: (x[1],x[0])) will sort list by 1st index element and then by 0th index element.
